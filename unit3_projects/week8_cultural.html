      <h2>A Journey in Pairing</h2>
        <p>As many of you probably know by now, I am new to programming.  That being said, pairing has been a very new experience.  So far, pairing has been a great experience.  Most of my future cohort is supportive, intelligent, empathetic and has great self-awareness.  I feel that these skills have helped to provide a wonderful cooperative environment.  Kudos to the recruitment team for putting together such a solid group of people!</p>
        
      
     <h2>Was pairing fun or rewarding?</h2> 
        
        <p>I would say that pairing is both fun and rewarding.  The process of working with another professional to solve a problem has its ups and downs (mostly ups).  For more difficult problems it has helped to have another set of eyes to help keep things moving forward.  The end result of a solved problem is always a rewarding feeling.</p>
        
        
     <h2>Is pairing frustrating?</h2>
        <p>Of course, things are not always perfect.  Pairing can get a bit frustrating at times.  This generally has very little to do with the person that I am working with.  However, sometimes both people in the pair have different ideas of how to solve the problem.  If your pair does not consider your ideas, it can be frustrating.  That being said, I will always do my best to make sure that my partner feels 'heard'.  There is always more than one way to attack a problem.  If you don't hear people out, you may be preventing yourself from learning a more effective method for solving a problem.</p>
        
    
     <h2>Overall:</h2>
        <p>In the end, I am grateful for learning how to pair.  I know that it is vital to get used to pairing, whether I plan to build my own app or work for a startup.  By pairing with my cohort, I have learned a great deal.  Hopefully, some of my cohort mates have learned a thing or two from me along the way as well.</p>
