      <h2>Thinking Styles</h2>
        <p>Today, I'm going to talk a little bit about the type of thinking style that I possess.  I'll then explain a bit about how that will affect my time at DBC.  After taking the 'thinking style' test, it turns out that I received 40 points in the <em>concrete random</em> section and <strong>32 points</strong> in the <em>Concrete Sequential</em> section.  This is what theorists are saying about concrete random thinkers:</p>
        <p><em>Concrete random thinkers are experimenters. says DePorter: "Like concrete sequentials, they're based in reality, but are willing to take more of a trial and error approach. Because of this, they often make the intuitive leaps necessary for true creative thought. They have a strong need to find alternatives and do things in their own way." If you're a CR, use your divergent thinking ability. Believe that it's good to see things from more than one viewpoint. Put yourself in a position to solve problems. But give yourself deadlines. Accept your need for change. Try and work with people who value divergent thinking.</em></p>
        
      
     <h2>How does this affect me?</h2>
        
        <p>After reviewing my results, I most agree with the results.  I also think this is probably the best result I could have gotten.  The facets of concrete random will all come in handy while learning how to program.  For example, "Likes experimenting to find answers, taking risks, using intuition, and solving problems independently."  These will all come in handy while learning at DBC and beyond.  However, there are downfalls to being concrete random like ,"..is stressed by restrictions and limitations, formal reports, routines, re-doing anything once it is done, keeping detailed records, showing how they got an answer, choosing only one answer, and having no options."</p>
        
        
        
    
     <h2>What has been my largest struggle throughout Phase: 0?</h2>
        <p>My largest struggle throughout DBC has been budgeting time.  I suppose this could be related to "restrictions and limitations" from above.  Throughout phase 0, I have been juggling 100 things at once, while trying to keep up with Phase 0 material.  This has proven to be difficult for me. I am looking forward starting Phase 1 and fully dedicating 100% of my time and attention to DBC material.  Fortunately, I don't have to many plans in place to make this happen.  I put a great deal of pressure on myself to succeed in life.  My self-applied pressure, coupled with the rigorous schedule of DBC should be enough to thrust me into the world of Software Development.  I am looking forward to the journey!  </p>
