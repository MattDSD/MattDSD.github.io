      <h2>SQL: A quick breakdown</h2>
        <p>First, let's take a quick look at what SQL is.  For the sake of simplifying, SQL is a special-purpose programming language designed for managing data held in a relational database management system.  Using SQL can improve the way that we are able to sort data without our website or web application.</p>
        
      <h2>What are some of the issues that we face using SQL?</h2>
        <p>After researching this top a bit, most of the complaints with SQL range from disliking syntax to complaints about the completeness of the language.  Another major complaint facing SQL databases is <strong>SQL Injection.</strong>According to one source,  "SQL injection attacks allow attackers to spoof identity, tamper with existing data, cause repudiation issues such as voiding transactions or changing balances, allow the complete disclosure of all data on the system, destroy the data or make it otherwise unavailable, and become administrators of the database server."  In short, SQL injection allows a user to access and tamper with your secure info.</p>
        <p>In the event that your website is hacked, you're basically screwed.  A hacker using SQL injection can really take you for a ride.  So what should you do to combat this? Well there are a few options you have.  First and foremost, you should make sure that your website/application is coded in a such a way to protect against data leaks.  Patching your servers, databases, programming languages and operating systems is also critical.  Additionally, you can run scans on your site to make sure that you don't have any breaches in the system.  While all of these will help combat SQL injection issues, I'm not sure that I have been able to find a 100% full proof plan to protect against hacking.</p>
        
      
     <h2>To SQL or not to SQL:</h2> 
        
        <p>Well as always, this question depends on what you are trying to accomplish.  From a developers standpoint, it is important to learn about SQL.  SQL is important to understand because it is everywhere.  While it may not be the most beloved programming language on the market, it is widely used and it does seem to improve data management in certain instances.</p>
        <p>So what are some reasons why we would want to avoid SQL?  In certain cases, joins in relational databases can slow down you programs significantly. People have complained that relational data does not map well.  Certain people on the web also claim that SQL doesn't map well with modern programming languages.</p>
        <p>On the plus side, people argue that most data can be easily mapped with SQL. SQL appears to be user friendly and easy to learn.  There are also many advocates claiming that it drastically improves the speed at which their team can access and manipulate data.</p>
        
     <h2>Making sense of it all</h2>
        <p>So what is the answer?  This is something you have to decide for yourself.  I personally see the value of using SQL and I am very excited to work with sites that use SQL.  My overall goal is not necessarily to work with 'big data' or large databases but learning SQL teaches you how to query.  Regardless of which direction your career in programming takes you, having a solid foundation of querying will only make you a better programmer in the end.</p>
