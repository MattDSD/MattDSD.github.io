      <h2>Values Revisited</h2>
        <p>If you have stuck with me throughout Phase 0, you'll remember that I wrote about the following values:<em>accomplishment, adventure, close relationships, creativity, excellence, fairness, freedom, self-respect, knowledge, power and wisdom.</em> For whatever reason, these values seemed to jump out me from the given list.  A few weeks have passed and I am now reviewing this list and it still holds true.  Seeing this values again helps me understand how I truly view myself.  In terms of programming, I think it will help me if I ever notice that I am in <em>stereotype threat</em></p>
        
      <h2>How I will use these values for good: </h2>
        <p>For the most part, I am a fairly positive person.  I also work hard for everything I have in life and I have been relatively successful at everything that I strive for.  Regardless, there are still moments when a negative thought or stereotype threat may creep into my mind.</p>
        
        <p>Moving forward I will be constantly reminding myself of what I am capable of when I feel negative thoughts coming on.  If I find myself sensing stereotype threat, I will choose to not let those thoughts linger.  Instead I can reaffirm what I stand for and how I will acheive my goals of becoming a programmer.</p>
      
     
        
      <h2>Other Jedi Mind Tricks</h2> 
        
        <p>So what other exercises can I use if I am feeling down at DBC?  Well, I hope this isn't an issue, but if I feel down I will use a combination of methods to resolve the issue.  I tend to run/lift when I am extremely stressed.  Nothing relieves stress like a good workout.  In addition to that, I have been getting into meditation more and more over the last few months.  Meditation seems to help a great deal with my overall wellness.  
        </p>
        <p>Aside from that, all I can do is eat well and tell myself that everything will be ok.  Afterall, it will be.</p>
