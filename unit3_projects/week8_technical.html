      <h2>Recursion: A Brief Look</h2>
        <p>I am going to do my best to give you a look at what recursion is in object-oriented programming.  I am by no means an expect programmer, but this post should at least give you a start in the right direction.  So without further ado, let's get started!</p>
        <p>For the sake of simplicity, recursion is basically when a function calls itself.  Recursion is used in order to take a larger problem and slowly break it down into small pieces.  As we are breaking the problem down into smaller pieces, we are feeding the input back into the function until our goal is achieved. </p>
        
      
     <h2>An example of recursion</h2>
        
        <p>While browsing the internet, the most common example you will see of recursion is surrounding the Fibonacci sequence.  That being said, I will not cover the Fibonacci sequence since you will probably see it on every other recursion site.  Additionally, I am not going to be typing code so I will do my best to describe a recursion example using the english language.  Brace yourself. </p>
        
        <p>In this example, lets pretend that we have a dinner plate filled with hundreds of tiny diamonds.  From this plate, we would like to select the largest diamond to give to our significant other.  The largest diamond represents our <em>base case</em>or end goal.  In order to determine the largest diamond, we will need to examine it in terms of weight by weighing each individual diamond one at a time.  Each time we weigh a diamond, we are one step closer to finding out which diamond is the largest.  The act of weighing each individual diamond is getting us closer and closer to our end goal.  These are both fundamental processes of recursion.  If you remember anything from this brief example, remember what base case is and that we are working towards our that end goal. </p>
        
    
     <h2>Overall:</h2>
        <p>So how would we use recursion to solve a problem?  We will use recursion when it makes sense to iterate through data piece by piece and return the result.  As I mentioned previously, this will help us break a larger problem down into smaller problems and eventually reach our end goal, whatever that may be.</p>
