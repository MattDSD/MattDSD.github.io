    <h1>Why pair program?</h1>
    <div id='content'>
    <p>
      Quality of work will increase by sharing ideas amongst an engineering team and within DBC<br>
      Helps build a stronger team, with more efficient and useful communication.<br>
      Learning from one another due to diverse backgrounds/experiences<br>
      People probably have more satisfaction for their jobs by working with a team vs. programming purely on their own<br>
      Leads to disagreement to refine ideas and come to a consensus<br>
      Sharing a common goal creates a more efficient work environment.<br>
      Two eyes are always better than one -- useful for debugging.<br>
