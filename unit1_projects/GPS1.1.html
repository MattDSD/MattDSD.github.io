    <h1>Why pair program?</h1>
    <div id='content'>
    <p>
      Quality of work will increase by sharing ideas amongst an engineering team and within DBC<br>
      Helps build a stronger team, with more efficient and useful communication.<br>
      Learning from one another due to diverse backgrounds/experiences<br>
      People probably have more satisfaction for their jobs by working with a team vs. programming purely on their own<br>
      Leads to disagreement to refine ideas and come to a consensus<br>
      Sharing a common goal creates a more efficient work environment.<br>
      Two eyes are always better than one -- useful for debugging.<br>

        <strong>What was it like to pair for the first time?                </strong> 
        </p>

Initially, I think we were both nervous but it turned out to be a fun experience.  I think we were both able to communicate well and learn a thing or two from one another.  I can definitely see how we will benefit from pair programming once our programming skills improve.

<strong>Did you enjoy it?</strong>
        </p>
        
I think we both enjoyed it.  Pair programming seems like a great way to collaborate on a project and pick up unique perspectives along the way.

<strong>What worked?</strong>
        </p>
        
Our ability to talk through ideas and our vision for the site worked well.  Once we were able to get past a few initial road blocks, we moved quickly through the project.  Arik was the driver and Matt was the navigator.  We both embraced our roles and respected each others opinions.  All of these things helped contribute to a successful pair programming session.

<strong>What didn't work?</strong>
        </p>
There were a few moments where we were doing silent research.  Neither of us really announced what we were doing, so our communication fell off a bit.  Moving forward, we will be more mindful of this and will give our programming partners notice so we remain on the same page.
