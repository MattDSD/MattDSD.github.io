      <h2>My take on DBC after Shereef's Fireside Chat:</h2>
        <p>After viewing the 'Fireside Chat' video by Shereef, I have learned a few new things.  Conversely, I also knew many of the details that were discussed in this video.  I have been looking through DBC videos and material relentlessly over the last few months.  That being said, I'll jump right into my reflection.  One interesting take on DBC that I had not initially considered is that we are in charge of our own fate.  We will get out what we put in.  I like this because I will most likely put <em>everything</em>into this program.</p>
        
      <h2>Impressions</h2>
        <p>My impressions really haven't changed that much.  I have always been very ecstatic about DBC and I still am after this video.  I like the collective culture within DBC and I love how quick my future cohort is to help one another.   I see this as a positive because I love helping others and sometimes I need to ask a question, or nine, myself.  It is beyond helpful to have a solid support system in place to help us throughout this learning process. Much of the help I have received so far came my future classmates.</p>
        <p>I see myself thriving in this environment because I love learning from other people.  We have plenty of knowledge to share with one another and we will inevitably learn from one another throughout the duration of this program.  The other aspect that I think I will thrive off of is the iterative process.  By that, I mean that we will learn a great deal through repetition.  Eventually, everything we are working on now will become second nature.  This is great because the best way to learn is through hands on experience.  I love this aspect and I look forward to full-immersion into the programming world.</p>
        
      
      <h2>A bit of introspection:</h2>
        <p>After completing this exercise, I was able to take a look inside and  determine what it will take from <strong>ME</strong> to succeed within DBC and beyond (this is not meant as an all-inclusive list). I plan to do the following:</p>
      <ol>
            <li>Recognize my weaknesses and acknowledge them</li>
            <li>Constantly work on my communication skills so I can effectively pair in the real world</li>
            <li>Do everything I can to succeed</li>
            <li>Ask questions</li>
            <li>Learn by teaching a concept that I feel strong about</li>
            <li>Practice, Practice, Practice (learn through repetition)</li>
            <li>Keep a clear head throughout the process</li>
            <li>Practice Empathy</li>
            <li>Network with other Devs</li>
            <li>Always be learning</li>
      </ol>   
         <p>I'm sure there is much more that I am not thinking of now, but these are the keys to success that I have picked up.  I am not nervous about whether or not I will find success.  As I mentioned in a previous post, I know that I will be a Software Engineer at some point.  It is just a matter of <em>when</em> I will be a Software Engineer.  I look forward to the journey!
