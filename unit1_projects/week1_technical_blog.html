    <h3>April 27th 2014</h3>
        <p>Today, for my first official DBC blog post, I am going to analyze my <strong>three</strong> of favorite websites.  I will be dissecting these sites in terms of user experience and their design.</p>
    
    <ol><strong>The three sites that I will be analyzing are:</strong> 
        <li>kentuckysportsradio.com</li>
        <li>stumbleupon.com</li>
        <li>espn.com</li>
        
    </ol>
    
    <p>Each of these websites present information in a very different way, however, they each serve the same purpose.  You might be asking yourself what these three sites have in common.  Give up yet?  <strong>NEWS! </strong>  They each deliver news in one way or another.  Although each of these sites have the same goal in mind, their designs differ greatly.  As a result, the user experience will differ greatly.  Let me explain..</p>
    
    
    <h3>Kentucky Sports Radio</h3>
        <p>Kentuckysportsradio.com was designed solely for the purpose of informing the University of Kentucky fanbase about anything related to their favorite UK sport.  The site has a very simple design.  By making the design simple, it is accessible to more people. Kentucky Sports Radio has a wide demographic, so it is important that their website is designed to meet the needs of the masses.  The average KSR reader can range from 16-80 years old, so ease of use and functionality play a huge part in the design of this page. 
 </p>
    <p>The design, color and logo were all designed using the team colors of blue and white.  This most likely allows users to quickly identify that they are on a UK sports page.  The user experience on this page is quite simple.  You scroll up and down the page and read the news.  If you need to navigate to a new sport, simply use the links along the top.  If you would like to comment on an article, click 'comment'.  Overall, the ease of use is what draws so many people to this site and helps to make it one of the best college sports blogs in the entire NCAA.  </p>
    
    <h3>Stumbleupon</h3>
    
        <p>Fox news and MSNBC not biased enough for you?  Fear not, you can decide exactly what information you absorb by using Stumbleupon.  The user experience on Stumbleupon is second to none because you literally control exactly what sort of information is placed before you.  Much like Kentucky Sports Radio, the user experience is fairly easy and is built for the masses.  Once you decide what information  you would like to <em>stumble</em> upon, you simply read the news and then click <strong>Stumble</strong> when you are ready to move on.  The design is modern, simple and can be used by nearly anyone.  Despite that, I imagine that mostly people in their 20s and 30s use this site.</p>
    <p>The user experience on Stumbleupon shouldn't be anything short of stellar if you have optimized the site to your preferences.  I have wasted hours on this site playing games, reading about programming and listening to music.  The design is nice enough for those that are picky and it is simple enough for those that require ease.  If you need to kill a few hours, this is not a bad way to do it.</p>
    
    <h3>ESPN</h3>
    
        <p>ESPN.com is a site that many are familiar with, whether you visit it or not.  If you aren't familiar, ESPN is a site that delivers sporting news and sport scores for nearly any sport imaginable.  When you first visit the site, your focus is drawn immediately to the center of the screen.  I assume the center of the screen is supposedly the sporting event or article that is deemed to be the most appealing to readers in your area (the site does use triangulation to determine your location and deliver relevant news).  From the main page, you can view scores along the top or articles throughout each page.  While cruising through their site, you will be consistently bombarded with ads.  That being said, the site was optimized for two things, how to direct users attention towards ad placement and how to direct readers attention towards the most <em>exciting</em> articles.</p>
    <p>By keeping users attention on the most exciting articles, ESPN's bounce-rate stays low.  This is a win-win for ESPN and advertisers alike. The overall user experience is solid once you have set up bookmarks and quick links for your favorite teams.  If you are new to the site, you may walk through a gauntlet of ads to before getting to the promised land of sports.  I would say the overall user experience is nice for a sporting site.  The design is cool, modern, and fairly easy to navigate.</p>
    <h3>Recap</h3>
        <p>To sum it all up, each of these sites set out to do the same thing, inform.  They all do it in different ways.  Stumbleupon allows you to choose the information that you would like to see.  It also does so in a modern/elegant manner.  With KSR, you get what you get.  You can scroll up and down and that is about it.  If you don't like what you are reading, you're probably not a Kentucky fan. ESPN, the most successful site out of the bunch, appears to be designed with advertisements in mind.  Despite that, the user experience is great on ESPN.  If you are looking for sporting news or just news in general, give one of these three sites a shot.</p>
