      <h2>Emotional Conflict: </h2>
        <p>Today, I am going to discuss emotional conflict.  In the world of a Software Engineer, it is important to be able to work well with others.  In the event that a conflict should arise, it is also important to know how you handle conflicts.  Without knowing how you handle shame and conflict, you have no way to gauge how effectively you deal with problems.  So lets go on a journey and get to "know thyself."</p>
        
      <h2>A personal example:</h2>
        <p>Roughly a year ago, I was in Atlanta, visiting my sister.  I rarely get to see her since I live in San Diego, CA, but when I do we usually have a good time.  She just had her second child, so I am now an uncle x2.  So, you would think this trip would only be a celebratory trip.  However, the first night I arrive, we get into a pretty big argument.</p>
        <p>My parents got divorced when I was in High School and since the divorce, my Sister and Mother have had a few rough patches.  So after she put the kids to bed, my Sister started bashing my Mom pretty hardcore.  I took offense to this because I have always been extremely close with my Mom (I guess that makes me a Momma's boy?).  Without getting very specific my Sister made some very distasteful comments and was questioning the character of our Mom.</p>
        <p>Needless to say, I was pissed.  Initially, I just tried to reason with her and change her mind, but that was useless.  After that failed, I tried to change the subject..fail.  Eventually, after carrying out this discussion for over an hour, I lost my cool and got started to <em>attack</em> her character for attacking my Mom (not very constructive, I know).  After arguing back and forth for awhile, we both went to bed angry.</p>
        <p>I'll save the remainder of the story for another post.  I can openly say that I did not handle the conflict properly.  Any conflict that ends in either individual losing their <em>cool</em> is not a successful interaction.  I typically don't like to examine what could have been, but in this case I will.  If I could go back and handle this situation differently, I would make sure that I never chose words that would attack my Sister.  By becoming verbally agressive with my Sister, I was only throwing fuel on the fire.  Moving forward, I need to take a deep breath in the moments when conflicts arise and come up with a more productive way of dealing with the conflict.</p>
      
     
        
      <h2>A bit of introspection:</h2>
        <p>After completing this exercise, I started thinking about the typical way that I handle shame. Usually, I am able to handle shame pretty well and I rarely let it get to me for an extended period of time.  For example, if I am rejected in some fashion or treated rudely by someone that I respect I tend to handle it quite well.  While it may sting in the immediate, I am generally able to reflect on this experience over time and get over it in a reasonable amount of time.</p>
        <p>After analyzing the Compass of Shame, I have come to the conclusion that I used to practice a combination of these defense mechanisms.  During my most shameful moments, I have practiced withdrawal, avoidance, and self-attack (never physical).  As I have grown through experience, I have learned what is worth fretting about and what isn't.  Generally, most of the 'shameful' things that once would lead me to react, no longer do.  I would like to think that I am well-adjusted and that I can draw on experience to handle shame properly.  
         </p>
        <p>As an adult, if I were to experience a shameful event, I would most likely try to handle it in the healthiest way possible without hurting anyone (myself included).  In the event that I cannot deal with the shame in a healthy way, the defense mechanism that I would most likely choose is <strong>Avoidance</strong>. While this may not be the healthiest way to get over a shameful experience, it allows me to remain social and still go on living my life until I can effectively deal with the problem.  Plus, I am not against going skydiving and having an adult beverage to help forget a painful experience.</p>
