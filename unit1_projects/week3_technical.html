      <h2>Javascript: What is it and why is it so popular?</h2>
        <p>Throughout the week, I have picked up on one thing.  Javascript kicks a$$! In a few short days, I think I have a better understanding of what Javascript does and why it is so integral in web development.  So what is Javascript anyways?  Well as many people may believe, it is not related to Java.  In fact, this is just an unfortunate naming convention gone wrong.  Javascript is a scripting language that is used to program the web.  By using JS, you can make a web page do what you want it to do.</p>
        
        <p>For example, Javascript is used to create interactivity on a web page.  If your page includes clicking, dragging, tapping or swiping, there is a good chance that Javascript helped make that happen.  Most commonly, we see JS used on the front-end, along with HTML and CSS.  Over time, there is an increase in JS being used on the back-end.</p>
        
      <h2>What do we NOT need Javascript for? </h2>
        <p>There are a many instances when it makes sense to use Javascript.  There are few instances when you don't necessarily need to.  For the most part, CSS can handle hover and focus events.  These events would include image swaps, rollover menus and tooltips.  In many cases, you are better off using CSS3 transitions instead of Javascript animations.  Also, HTML form controls can often be used instead of custom JS widgets.  From what I read, this is especially true for mobile applications.  Through my research, these are the most common instances that JS is not needed.</p>
        
        
      <h2>Most common practices</h2>
        <p>Here are some of the most common practices for using Javascript, according to my research:</p>
      <ol>
            <li>Loading new page content</li>
            <li>Page Animation</li>
            <li>Interactive web content (games, audio, and video)</li>
            <li>Transmitting our browsing habits back to the website (similar to Google Analytics)</li>
            <li>Validating web forms (making sure you typed in a phone number when a form asks for a phone number)</li>
            <li>Make applications more responsive</li>
    
            
      </ol>  
      <h2>Why is it so popular?</h2>
         <p>So why is Javascript so popular? I did a little bit of research and I think the best reason I found was that it is fully supported by ALL browsers and it easily integrated into HTML/CSS and background services like AJAX.  On top of that, Javascript allows for object-oriented design, which can be an advantage when working on a project.  Through reading, I also found that Javascript is relatively easy to learn, easy to edit and easy to debug.  There are also plenty of tools that can interpret, extend the power of JS, and enhance capabilities of JS (jQuery, AJAX, Node.js, Meteor, etc.)  In many ways, Javascript seems like it is here to stay.</p>
