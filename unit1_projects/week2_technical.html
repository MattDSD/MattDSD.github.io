        <h2>April 30th, 2014</h2>
            <p>Today, I will be covering a couple HTML and              CSS topics that I have recently learned.                  Hopefully my post can help someone else                    learn basic HTML/CSS.  The first topic that I              will be discussing is the difference between              inline vs. inline blocks.  I am still fairly              new to this subject, so I still have much to              learn.  That being said, I will let you know              what I have learned thus far. </p>
        <h2>What does it mean to display inline vs.                 inline-blocks?</h2>
        <p>For the purpose of styling your elements, you            have several different options for displaying.            Two of the most common elements for displaying            your elements are <em>inline</em> and <em>block-          inline</em>.</p>
        <h2>What is a block element?</h2>
            <p>The easiest way to remember block elements              is by considering that blocks typically start              and end with a new line when displayed in the              browser.  So what does this mean for your                  page?  Essentially, block elements break up                the flow of your page.  Consider the                      following image:</p>
        <img class="picture" src="images/block.jpg">
        
        <p>As you can see from the illustration above, a            block-display element will also span the full              width of the space available to it, and so will            start on a new line in the flow of HTML. The flow          will continue on a new line after the block-              display element. Now that we have that down, lets          move on to inline elements.</p>
        <h2>What is an inline element? </h2>
        
        <p>An inline element is just that, inline.  These          elements do not break up the flow of the page and          do not result in text beginning on the next line.          You can display inline elements within a text box          and the text can continue right after the inline          element.  Take a look at this illustration for            further proof:</p>
        
        <img class="picture" src="images/inline.jpg">
        
        <p>As you can see here, the inline element does            not break up the flow of text.  It simply fits            right in, allowing your text to continue flowing          around the element.  At the moment, this is the            extent of my block vs. inline-block element                knowledge.  I will be sure to post additional              48useful resources as my knowledge grows.</p>
