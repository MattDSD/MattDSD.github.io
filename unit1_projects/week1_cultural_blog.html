        <h2>May 1st, 2014</h2>
            <p>When I think of the times in my life when I have been the happiest, proudest or most satisfied, the following values come to mind: <em>accomplishment, adventure, close relationships, creativity, excellence, fairness, freedom, self-respect, knowledge, power and wisdom.</em>  </p>
        <h2>The value that I identify with most</h2>
        <p>Of these values, one reigns supreme.  Most of my proudest moments are centered around <em>close relationships</em>.  Whether I accomplished something great or I went on a wild adventure, none of those things would be the same without close relationships.  </p>
        <p>I remember getting good grades as a kid.  For me, the actual act of getting a good grade was very rewarding.  However, sharing that experience with my family was much more rewarding.  The same rule applied to my competitve swimming career.  Winning a race was nice, but if you didn't have people to celebrate with, then it would not have been quite as enjoyable.</p>
        <h2>Rating the values:</h2>
            <p>I will now be rating the values that I have chosen based on whether or not I agree that I try to live up to these values.  1 being that I don't try to live up to the value and 5 that I fully try to live up to the value.</p>
        <div class="values">
        <ul>
            <li>Accomplishment-5</li>
            <li>Adventure-5</li>
            <li>Fairness-5</li>
            <li>Excellence-5</li>
            <li>Close relationships-5</li>
            <li>Creativity-5</li>
            <li>Freedom-5</li>
            <li>Self-Respect-5</li>
            <li>Knowledge-5</li>
            <li>Power-5</li>
            <li>Wisdom-5</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <p>It might seem a little bit boring that I gave myself a perfect 5 for each of these values.  When I truly look within myself, I feel I 100% agree that I try to embody each of these values on a daily basis.  Am I perfect at doing so, of course not.  I still try to strive to meet these values and various other values.</p>        
        
        <h2>What was the last topic that someone asked for advice on?</h2>
        
        <p>The last person that asked for my advice was my girlfriend.  She asked for my advice on interviewing for new jobs because she is moving with me to San Francisco.  I have been through many interviews and I would say that I do pretty well during most interviews.  We spent a couple hours breaking down all of the information that I know and then practicing it.  I will update you on how this transfer of knowledge worked out!</p>
