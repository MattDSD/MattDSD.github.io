      <h2>The wireframe for my index.html page</h2>
        <p>Today, I am briefly going to describe how I will be designing my              index.html webpage.  My index.html webpage will be the first thing that          prospective employers and prospective clients will see when they they            visit my page in the future.  This page will act as a showcase for my            talents and will be an extension of my personality.</p>
      <h2>Here is a mockup for the general layout:</h2>

      <h2>My goal for this wireframe:</h2>
        <p>My overall goal of this project is to create a landing page that will          give prospective clients and employers an idea of what type of work I            do.  I would like the page to be an extension of my image.  I will try          to keep the page elegant, classy and modern. Top left, I plan to design          a logo infused into my name. Top right, I will have links to my work, a          page that tells about me and a link to this wonderful blog that you are          enjoying now. Below that, I will have a large image of myself that is            with a captivating backdrop.  Below the image, I will have links to my          social media and general accomplishments listed. Feedback is welcome,            as always.</p>
