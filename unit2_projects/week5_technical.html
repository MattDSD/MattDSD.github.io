      <h2>Getting Classy with Classes</h2>
        <p>Today, I am going to be discussing a few things related to Classes in Ruby.  I'll go into details on when, why and how you use classes.  I'll then give a description of how data structures and classes can model real world objects.  So, let's get started!</p>
        
      <h2>Class is in session</h2>
        <p>In short, classes are the basic template from which object instances are created. A class is made up of a collection of variables representing internal state and methods providing behaviours that operate on that state.  In simpler terms, a class holds all of the variables and attributes for a particular object.  For example, if we created a class for 'car', we would then put variables related to that car within the class.  So we might, put topSpeed= 125, to signify the top speed that our car can go.  </p>
        
        <p>If it is not already apparent on why we use classes, then I will better explain.  We use classes in programming for several reasons. The main reason we use classes is to make our code more readable and easier to understand.  For example, you may need to create two separate classes for two different makes of a vehicle.  If you only had one class titled car, it would become difficult to determine which methods belong to which car.  In the end, your programmed cars would most likely not run very smoothly.</p>
      
     
        
      <h2>Breaking it down</h2> 
        
        <p>So how can we actually use this information when we are ready to create our first program? Simply put, we can use classes to make our code better.  When we are building larger and more scalable programs, we may need to create class variables that have a larger reach.  By creating classes, we are able to also distinguish between instance methods that are only to be used once and class methods that can be called on the entire class. 
        </p>
        
         <p>Let's consider the following.  Assume that the car factory is the class. The car class has a class method buildCar. The buildCar method takes parameters and builds the details surround the car. You could assign variables that detail the car color, speed, and weight. Once you've created a car, that particular car has state variables that store things like the channel on the radio, the amount of gas left in the tank, the mileage on the odometer, the wear level on the brakes, etc. Different cars will have different values for those variables.</p>
        
        <p><em>In short, classes allow us to get more detailed with our programming.  Hopefully the preceding example helps you better understand how to use classes in the future.</em></p>
