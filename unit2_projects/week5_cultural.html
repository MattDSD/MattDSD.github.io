      <h2>Problems Facing the Tech World</h2>
        <p>After doing a bit of research, there are several concerning factors that are affecting the tech world.  One of the major issues that seems to come up repeatedly is the fact that the programming world is largely male dominated.  This leads many people to believe that the tech world has a bit of a misogynistic attitude.  While I feel that this issue has huge room for improvement, I am not here to talk about that.  The issue I would like to discuss is the efficacy of the applications and programs that are produced.</p>
        
        
      <h2>Why is this a problem?</h2>
        
        <p>Consider all of the luxuries you use on a daily basis.  What would you do if they stopped working?  In some cases, your day would go on interrupted.  In other scenarios, you would be deeply affected.  I would guess that most people are dependent on one or more applications/products than they should be and that presents a problem. What if that program quits working?</p>
        <p>If the failed application is something like Siri, no big deal.  If the failed application is your bank security system, you might be in trouble.  Other issues that are also greatly catastrophic include: flight technology failing mid-flight, your financial information being hacked from a website, major power outtages, servers overloading, and programs that simply don't do what they say they will.</p>
      
     
        
      <h2>Possible Solutions</h2> 
        
        <p>While I don't have immediate solutions to solve these issues myself, measures have to be taken to mitigate possible risks.  I am not an expert on these subjects but I will throw out a few solutions for the sake of argument: 
        </p>
        <ul class="solutions">
            <li class="solutions">-Invest more time and money into the testing phase</li>
            <li class="solutions">-Hire the worlds best hackers to try to hack your programs-if they can be hacked, fix it</li>
            <li class="solutions">-Invest more in your security</li>
            <li class="solutions">-Create a failsafe in the event that something goes wrong</li>
        </ul>
         <p>These solutions were made with very little knowledge of the innerworkings of an application.  Despite that, I'm sure these are considerations that any Software Developer should pay attention to.  Whether you are making the next Siri or you are planning to work for Nasa one day, it is important to consider how you will prevent your application from failing.</p>
