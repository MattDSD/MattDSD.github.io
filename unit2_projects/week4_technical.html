      <h2>Arrays vs. Hashes: What are they good for? </h2>
        <p>Arrays and Hashes are an integral part of programming.  They both organize data through collections.  Arrays are ordered collections, meaning that they have an index order that begins at 0 and ends at -1 (on the far right). Any object can be stored in an array, including other arrays, hashes, filehandles, classes, true and false.  You can then access these objects by using their index. Remember, any object can be stored within an array.</p>
        <p>Hashes have a similar function, to store objects.  However, a hash stores data using key and value pairs.  You would then access information in a hash by <em>key</em> indexing.  Unlike an array, hashes remember the order that you inserted a value.  Hashes use this order to iterate throughout the key-value pairs. </p>
        
      <h2>What are hashes used for?</h2>
        
        <ul class="hash">
            <li class="hash">-Store complete strings along with their abbreviations as values</li>
            <li class="hash">-Menu items and their prices</li>
            <li class="hash">-Store a political figure and their date of birth</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>What are arrays used for?</h2>
        
        <ul class ="array">
          <li class="array">-Storing a split string to concatenate later</li>
          <li class="array">-List ingredients in a food item</li>
          <li class="array">-Store students grades</li>
        </ul>
      
     
        
      <h2>How to decide which one to use: Array vs. Hash</h2>
        <p>The above lists are by no means inclusive.  These are simply a few examples to illustrate how you can use an array or a hash.  Hashes and arrays seem so similar.  So how do we determine which one to use in each situation?  This might be an oversimplification, but if order is not important and you have a need for key/value pairs, it might make sense to use hashes. When I mention order not being important, I say this because hashes do not auto sort input.  A hash displays information in the order that it was input.  If you need to add a hash key-value, you are simply inserted instead of appended.</p>
        <p>Arrays are typically going to be used to handle collections of objects.  Arrays seem to be more widely used.  You will want to 'think array' if you are tackling a project that requires a list to be ordered.  For example, if you are compiling an application that builds a calendar.  You will want to use an array to store the days or the week or the dates of the month.  Again, these are not all-inclusive solutions.  There are times when you could use either an array or a hash.  At that time, it might be a matter of preference.</p>
